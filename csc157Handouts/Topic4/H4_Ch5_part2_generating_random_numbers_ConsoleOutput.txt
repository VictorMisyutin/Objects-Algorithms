first run:

Chapter 5 Functions part 2 value returning functions: generating random numbers
Read textbook Gaddis 4E, pages 239-249
There is example with random numbers generator in this handout 
Do you want to generate the same sequence of random numbers when you run program next time? y/n: y
We set seed
random integer number between 1 and 1 is  1
random integer number between 1 and 2 is  2
random integer number between 1 and 3 is  2
random integer number between 1 and 4 is  1
print 5 random integer numbers between 5 and 20
0 .  11
1 .  19
2 .  20
3 .  13
4 .  10
random integer number such as 0<=number<4 is  0
random integer number such as 4<=number<8 is  7
random integer number such as 4<=number<10, with step 2 is  6
random floating point number such as 0.0<=number<1.0 is  0.07608934678134815
random floating point number such as 1.0<=number<5.0 is  4.809596924567726
