    You can find information online by searching 
    'Python functions'
    
A function is a group of statements that exist within 
    a program for the purpose of performing a specific task
There the two types of functions: 
void functions and value-returning functions

    def function_name():
         statement
         statement
         etc.
    

    #call function
    function_name()
    

    def main():
         statement
         statement
         etc.
    

    #call the main function
    main()

What is day of the week today? Saturday
day is local variable inside function message()
A local vaiable is created inside a function and cannot
be accessded by statement that are outside the function.
Different functions can have local variables with the same names
because the functions cannot see each other's local variables.
Today is Saturday
The weather today is nice. Isn't it? y or yes or :) :)
I am glad, that you are agree with me.
Please enter the length of the room in inches: 7
Please enter the width  of the room in inches: 8
Passing arguments to a function areaOfRectangle()
area OfRectangle with length 7 and width 8 is equal to  56
Please enter integer value 44444
you just inputed value 44444
inside function set_to_zero()
does not matter what you inputed, now local variable value is 0
We are back. Does not matter that function changed value, now value is 44444
Global variable some_global =  55555
Let's change global variable some_global, enter new value: 1111
Global variable some_global =  1111
Simulation of global constant PI= 3.14
