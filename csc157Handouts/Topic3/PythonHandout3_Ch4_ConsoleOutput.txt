The while Loop: A Condition-Controlled Loop
while is a Pretest Loop

while condition:
     statement
     statement
     etc.

0
We must eventually change the value of condition,
    condition must eventually become False
     otherwise we will get infinite loop
     
Repeat? y/n: y
1
We must eventually change the value of condition,
    condition must eventually become False
     otherwise we will get infinite loop
     
Repeat? y/n: y
2
We must eventually change the value of condition,
    condition must eventually become False
     otherwise we will get infinite loop
     
Repeat? y/n: n
The for Loop: A Count-Controlled Loop

for variable in [value1, value2, etc.]:
     statement
     statement
     etc.

Using the range Function with the for Loop

for num in range(5):
     print (num)
     
gives the same output as

for num in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
     print (num).

0

4
gives the same output as
0
1

4

for num in range(1, 5):
     print (num)
     
gives the same output as

for num in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
     print (num).

for num in range(5):
     print (num)
     
gives the same output as

for num in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
     print (num).

for num in range(1, 10, 2):   #2 is step here
     print (num)
     
gives the same output as

for num in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]:
     print (num).

See in the handout assignment statements
x= 9
x=x+2, x= 11
x=x-1, x= 10
x=x*3, x= 30
x=x/2, x= 15.0
x=x//2, x= 7.0
x=x%3, x= 1.0
The Augmented Assignment operators: +=,-=,*=,/+,%=
x= 9
x+=2, x= 11
x-=1, x= 10
x*=3, x= 30
x/=2, x= 15.0
x//=2, x= 7.0
x%=3, x= 1.0
