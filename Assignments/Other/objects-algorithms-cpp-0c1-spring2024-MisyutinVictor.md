1) What was the most difficult topic in the course?
    **RSA Encryption**


2) What was the easiest topic?
    **SumOfK**


3) What would you add/delete/change in the course?
    **I think there should be a small introduction to threading**


4) By the end of the course do you enjoy programming more than in the beginning? (yes/no): 
    **yes**


5) Why?
    **I have always enjoyed programming, and the better I get at it the more I like it. Since this course made me a better programmer it made me enjoy programming more. Also, the course has some intresting topics such as hashing and encryption which were fun to learn about.**


6) What do you particularly like/dislike?
    **I liked that for most of the labs there were example outputs for some of the input files. However some of the labs are a little but vague. For example. in the RSA lab, I did not know how to encrypt and display UNICODE values.**


7) When you write a program, do you use exceptions and inheritance? 
(I recommend their usage).
    **I usually use exceptions in my program when using user inputs when I am too lazy to check that they entered a valid input. However, I do not usually use inheritance.**


8) Have energy and enthusiasm for future courses! 
What are your plans with computer science?
    **I am transfering to UIUC after this semester and I hope to get a computer science degree there. After that, I hope to find a job in software development and work on a lot of personal projects.**


9) What would you tell me by the end of the course?
    **Nothing really, I really liked this class even though it was a little difficult. Also, I think it would be nice if you had office hours a couple of times throughout the semester.**


10) What are your recommendations to my future students?
    **Try not to get behind and start your labs earlier than you think**


11) What are your recommendations to me?
    **Other than maybe holding office hours, none.**


12) Can I use your work as an example for my future students in my future teaching? (yes/no): 
    **yes**

Thank you for studying with me this semester.
By the end of the semester you will have good habits to write programs and text for discussions.
Keep the same habits and good luck in the future!
